SmackTop is a utility for Mac laptops (after 2005) which translates the accelerometer (Sudden Motion Sensor) data into MIDI messages.  This enables the user to control their favorite DAW by smacking their laptop.  The Mac Air series does not (to my knowledge) have an accelerometerâ€¦sorry.  Mileage may vary, depending on your [laptop model](http://code.google.com/p/smacktop/wiki/LaptopCompatibility03)

SmackTop analyzes the accelerometer's output to detect 'smacks' and classify them into four directions.  Each of these smacks can send a unique MIDI note and/or control change message.

SmackTop was written in Processing.  It is licensed under GNU GPL 2.0, although the included libraries are subject to their own various GNU or CC licenses (see bottom).
